$ Test absolute path imports
$ UTTR supports relative paths (like "module" or "subdir/module") 
$ but not absolute file system paths (like "C:/path/to/module")
$ This is by design to keep modules portable

$ Test 1: Verify relative import works
bring format_name from modules/helpers;
show "Test 1: Relative import works - " + format_name("John", "Doe");

$ Test 2: Import from nested subdirectory
bring deep_function from modules/subdir/deep_module;
show "Test 2: Nested subdir import works - " + deep_function();

$ Test 3: Multiple levels of nesting
bring use_sibling from modules/subdir/import_sibling;
put use_sibling() in result;
show "Test 3: Multi-level nesting works - result = " + result;

$ Test 4: Verify we can't use absolute paths (should fail gracefully)
$ Note: This would need to be tested separately as it will cause an error
$ bring something from C:/absolute/path/module;

show "All relative path tests passed!";
